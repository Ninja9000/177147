# 177147
177147 is a parody of the game 2048, a clone of a game of the same name, which, in turn, was derived from the game 1024!

This game is different in that it uses three as a numerical motif, with tiles having powers of three and with three axes of movement.

Expect badness and madness to ensue.

Extremely cursed code, with credit to [ced-h](https://github.com/cedric-h).
