# 177147
177147 is a parody of the game 2048, a clone of a game of the same name, which, in turn, was derived from the game 1024!

This game is different in that it centers around 3, both in having powers of 3 replace powers of 2 and by having three axes of movement.

Expect badness and madness to ensue.
